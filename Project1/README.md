Background: This is a secondary data analysis of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, which an ongoing prospective cohort study of the natural and treated histories of HIV-1 infection in homosexual and bisexual men, in four major cities in the United States. Highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) is the standard treatment for HIV infected patients. The data include up to 8 years of longitudinal laboratory and quality of life measures, in addition to demographic and other health information, on HIV infected men after beginning HAART.

There are four measures of treatment response. The first two are laboratory measures, viral load (VLOAD), which is the number of HIV copies in one mL of blood, and the second, is CD4+ T cell count (LEU3N), a measure of immunologic health. In untreated HIV infection, viral load increases over time and CD4+ T cell counts decline as the immune system is attacked by the virus. Once treatment is initiated, the investigators expect viral load to decrease rapidly and CD4 counts to recover. The final two measures are quality of life measures from the SF-36. The first is the aggregate physical quality of life score (AGG_PHYS) and the second is the aggregate mental quality of life score (AGG_MENT). These scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. It is unclear what happens to quality of life after initiating treatment.

The research team is interested in how treatment response 2 years after initiating HAART is differerent between subjects who report using hard drugs, such as heroine and cocaine, at baseline and other subjects, who did not report hard drug use at baseline. The investigators have identified several variables of interest, that may have an impact on all four otucome measures, including: age, BMI, smoking status, education, race/ethnicity, and adherence.
