Background: Cortisol and DHEA are two hormones that regulate our stress system. Cortisol is known to have a peak shortly after waking and then falls over the day to a low in the evening. Features of this diurnal pattern have been implicated in depression, sleep disorders and many other conditions. Being able to collect samples to measure this curve in a natural environment (e.g. at home) is useful for research on this endocrine system. The accuracy of saliva sample collection is crucial to obtaining reliable characterization of the cortisol awakening response and perhaps defining the diurnal decline in salivary cortisol. 

We tested the use of a convenient and novel collection device for collecting saliva on strips of filter paper in a specially constructed booklet for determination of both salivary cortisol and DHEA.  In the present study, 31 healthy control subjects collected saliva samples four times a day for three days using the filter paper device (Saliva Procurement and Integrated Testing (SPIT) booklet) which was maintained during the collection period in a large plastic bottle with an electronic monitoring cap. Subjects were asked to collect saliva samples at waking, 30 min later, before lunch and 600 min after waking.  The time of waking and the time before lunch were allowed to vary by the subjects’ schedules.

Our questions are: 1) what is the agreement between the subject’s recordings of sampling times compared to the times recorded by an electronic monitoring cap?, 2) are subjects adhering accurately to the +30min and +10 hour sampling times required by a study protocol?, 3) what are the changes of cortisol and DHEA over time?
