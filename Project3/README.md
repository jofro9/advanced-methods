This is the repository for the project work for Project 1 Bios6624 for Joseph Froelicher. 

Background: Beginning in 1948, subjects were enrolled in a Heart disease study in the city of Framingham, Massachusetts. Our data come from a subset of that data consisting of the years 1956 - 1968. Participants were followed by hospital visits, participant contact and through death certificates for the occurrence of Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Failure, and Cerebrovascular disease. Using the 10-year probability of stroked based on different risk profiles, the goal is to identify any risk factors for stroke based on our data.

Using the provided Framingham heart data, we are interested in determining which risk factors are most associated with increased hazard of having a stroke, determining the 10 year risk for different risk profiles, and analyzing how much temporal change in the associated risk factors, and whether a more sophisticated temporal analysis is needed. Those associated risk factors include four categorical variables, presence of cardiovascular disease, smoking status, presence of diabetes, and treatment for hypertension, as well as four continuous risk factors, age, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and cholesterol level.
